# The Importance of Critical Reading

---

Do you find yourself struggling to understand what you read? Do you often forget what you read just minutes after finishing a text? These negative questions are common for many students, but the solution is to develop critical reading skills. By making actionable recommendations and setting high expectations for ourselves, we can become better readers and improve our overall academic performance.

One recommendation for improving critical reading skills is to actively engage with the text. This means highlighting key phrases or ideas, taking notes, and asking questions. By actively reading and questioning the text, we can better understand the author's intentions and message.

Another recommendation is to read with a purpose. Before diving into a text, it's important to ask ourselves, "What do I want to gain from reading this?" By setting a clear purpose or goal, we can focus our attention and retain information more effectively.

In addition to these recommendations, it's important to have high expectations for ourselves as readers. This means setting challenging reading goals and striving to improve our comprehension and analysis skills. By pushing ourselves to read more difficult texts and actively seeking out opportunities to practice critical reading, we can become better readers and achieve greater academic success.

Questions like "Why is reading so hard?" or "Why can't I remember what I read?" can be discouraging, but it's important to reframe these questions into positive ones. Instead of focusing on our struggles, we should ask ourselves, "What can I do to improve my reading skills?" or "How can I better engage with the text?" By reframing these questions, we can take action to improve our skills and reach our goals.

In conclusion, critical reading skills are crucial for academic success. By making actionable recommendations, setting high expectations, and reframing negative questions into positive ones, we can become better readers and achieve our academic goals. Remember, developing critical reading skills takes practice and dedication, but the rewards are well worth the effort.
